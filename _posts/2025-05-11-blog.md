Today is the first day of my 21 Days of Achievement. The goal is to solidify multiple daily tasks/habits over the next three weeks. 
Tasks include drinking a gallon of water, 1 hour of reading, and being in bed and waking up by certain times, etc.
I'm recording completion in a habit tracker. The organization and display of all my daily habits gives me a sense of accomplishment upon recording, and furthermore allows me to see the day's remaining tasks.
